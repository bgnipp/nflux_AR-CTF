nFlux is an augmented reality game similar to capture the flag that is played in real life. The app keeps score, makes it impossible to cheat, and introduces fun new features. Think of it as a cross between real world sports and video games. It’s a fun way to enjoy the outdoors with friends while getting great exercise. 

Players split into two even teams, each consisting of one to five players. One team plays offense, and the other plays defense. Optional: players place their phone in an arm-band so that they can quickly glance at it as they move around.

When the game is set up, two virtual zones are placed on the playing field: the flag zone (which the defense team defends), and the offense base zone (where players on the offense team return to "recharge").

Offense players attempt to sneak into the flag zone without getting tagged by a defense player. When a defense players gets within about 10 feet from an offense player, the app recognizes a "tag" (via Bluetooth). Tagged offense players must return to the base zone before they are able to continue (otherwise, the app does not allow them to capture the flag).

The offense team wins when a player enters the flag zone, stays within it for a period of time (“capturing the flag”), and then returns to base, all without being tagged. The defense team wins if they successfully defend the flag until time runs out. 

Throughout the game, “items” drop on the playing field. Players can pick these up (by walking over them) and use them to gain a unique advantage. “Funds” can also be picked up, which can be used to purchase items during the game.
